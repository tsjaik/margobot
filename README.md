## Exp

- The bot searches for the nearest mob from the list, then finds the optimal path, and moves by simulating keyboard button presses.
- The bot roams around maps and moves to the next one when it doesn’t detect any mobs.
- The bot has a function to navigate to a specific map for exping (e.g., after death).
- Option to input groups that the bot should ignore.

## E2 (elite 2 mobs)

- The bot waits for E2 to appear and then attacks after a random delay.
- Option to set minimum and maximum delay times before the bot attacks.

## Anti-bot System (Captcha)
- A captcha appears periodically, which the bot solves after a random delay.
- The bot detects images with lines and marks the appropriate answers.

## Universal Options

- Automatic healing
- Automatic restocking of arrows
- Bot stops if healing items or arrows run out to avoid death
